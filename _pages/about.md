Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a PhD Student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and expect to graduate in 2026. My research lies at the crossroads of Multimedia Technology and the Fashion Industry.

My current research focuses on applying multimedia and computer vision to the fashion industry, such as fashion object detection, fashion sketch colorization, and virtual try-on.
