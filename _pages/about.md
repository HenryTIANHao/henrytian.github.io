Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Ph.D. Student at the School of Fashion and Textile, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR. I expect to graduate in 2026. My research lies at the crossroads of Multimedia Technology and Fashion Industry.

My current research focuses on the application of computer vision to the fashion industry, such as fashion object detection, fashion sketch colorization and virtual try-on.
